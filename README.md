You will find to files :
- Needleman-Wunsch.py : Classic implementation of Needleman-Wunsch for the global alignement that I created.
- Needleman-Wunsch-4russians.py : Like as before but with somes elements that take parts in the Four Russians methods : Size of a block, Lookup table...

For both of them the gap between the start of the algorithm and the end time is mesuread.
